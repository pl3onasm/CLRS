## Notes

The aim is to implement all the algorithms and data structures discussed in the textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, et al. The third edition of this textbook will be referred to as CLRS³, and the fourth edition as CLRS⁴. I chose to keep the code in one file per algorithm, in order to keep some overview, and make it easier to find things. Folders usually contain several versions of the same algorithm or data structure, in order to compare, test, and improve the implementations.

In addition, you will also find a few other algorithms and data structures that are not discussed or merely referenced in the book. All implementations will be in C, and will follow the pseudocode—if available—in the textbook as closely as possible, unless this results in a less efficient or unnecessarily complex implementation. I strive to make the code as transparent and economical as possible, and have it reflect the underlying reasoning. Brief explanations and summaries of the algorithms and data structures will be added as well.  

Please refer to the license if you wish to use any of the code in this repository. If a link does not work, this is probably because the code is not yet available. Any images were created using Photoshop. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know. Some of the solutions to the textbook's exercises can be found on [this site](https://walkccc.me/CLRS/), although these are not always optimal or even correct.

Note that this is a work in progress. Some explanations and summaries are still incomplete or missing and some code is not yet available. Updates will be made regularly.
