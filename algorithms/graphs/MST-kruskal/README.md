$\Large{\color{rosybrown}\text{Problem}}$

Given a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, in which each edge $(u, v) \in E$ has a weight $w(u, v)$, find a spanning tree with minimum total weight. A *spanning tree* is a subset of $n - 1$ edges that forms a tree (i.e. an acyclic connected graph) that includes every vertex. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of its edges: $\sum_{(u, v) \in T} w(u, v)$. Note that a spanning tree always has $n - 1$ edges. A *minimum* spanning tree is just a spanning tree with minimum total weight. Also note that a graph may have more than one minimum spanning tree.

$\Large{\color{darkseagreen}\text{Kruskal's algorithm}}$

In Kruskal's algorithm, we start with a forest of trees, where each tree is a single vertex, and sort the edges in increasing order of their weights. We then try adding an edge to the forest, that is, we try merging the two trees that the edge connects. We do this for all the edges, one by one, in increasing order of their weights. If adding an edge would create a cycle, we don't add it and move on to the next edge. We continue until we have added $n - 1$ edges and have found a minimum spanning tree.

In order to implement Kruskal's algorithm, we need a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

* Find the set that a given element belongs to
* Merge two sets into one
* Create a new set containing a single element

The most efficient data structure for this is the ${\color{peru}\text{disjoint-set data structure}}$. We can implement this using a [union-find](https://github.com/pl3onasm/CLRS/tree/main/datastructures/union-find) data structure. This data structure is a forest of trees, where each tree represents a set. Each node in the tree has a pointer to its parent and a rank, which is the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf. So a singleton set is represented by a tree with a single node, whose parent is itself and whose rank is 0. The union operation is performed by merging the trees with the smaller rank into the tree with the larger rank. The find operation is performed by following the parent pointers until we reach a node whose parent is itself. This node is the root of the tree, i.e. the representative element of the set.  

Implementing the disjoint-set data structure this way results in a better running time than implementing it using linked lists. This is mainly due to the use of two heuristics: ${\color{peru}\text{path compression}}$ and ${\color{peru}\text{union by rank}}$. Path compression is achieved by making each node in the path from the node to the root point directly to the root. Union by rank is performed by merging the tree with the smaller rank into the tree with the larger rank, and adding 1 to the rank of the resulting tree if the ranks are equal. For a detailed explanation of the union-find data structure and the heuristics, see CLRS³ 21.3, or CLRS⁴ 19.3.

The running time of this algorithm using a *union-find* data structure is $\mathcal{O}(E \log E)$, since we need to sort the edges in increasing order of their weights, and we need to perform $|E|$ operations on a disjoint-set data structure, each of which takes $\mathcal{O}(\alpha(V))$ time, where $\alpha(V)$ is the inverse Ackermann function. This is a very slow function, but it is still bounded by a constant, so we can ignore it. Thus, the running time of Kruskal's algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(E \log E)$, which is the same as $\mathcal{O}(E \log V)$, since $E \leq V^2$.
