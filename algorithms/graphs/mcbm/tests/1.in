CLRS⁴ Figure 25.1

The numbers in L could be numbers identifying 7 persons, 
and the numbers in R could each identify books in a library 
that are available for loan. 
The edges in the graph could then represent the books that 
each person has listed as being of interest to them.
These edges are unweighted: each person wants to read each 
book they've listed with equal preference.
The maximum cardinality matching ensures that as many 
people as possible get a book they want to read.
