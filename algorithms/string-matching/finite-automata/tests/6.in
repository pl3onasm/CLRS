quaternion
On October 16, 1843, Sir William Rowan Hamilton was crossing the Royal Canal, Dublin,
with his wife, on his way to presiding over a meeting of the Royal Irish Academy.
While crossing Brougham Bridge, he had a moment of inspiration, and discovered the
quaternions, in the process carving their fundamental equation i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1
into the stone of this bridge. Since 1989, an annual ‘pilgrimage’ called the Hamilton
Walk is held from Dunsink Observatory to this Royal Canal bridge, in which scientists
and mathematicians remember this inspirational moment.
The year 1843 was around the time that mathematicians were attempting to put the
concept of complex numbers, a two-dimensional system based on the equation i2 = -1,
on a more solid, mathematical footing. Hamilton was trying, unsuccessfully, to obtain
a three-dimensional system of numbers akin to the two-dimensional complex numbers.
For some reason, his focus must have shifted momentarily to a four-dimensional system,
perhaps due to the futility of his three-dimensional endeavours. While crossing this
bridge, this idea of a system of numbers based on the four numbers 1, i, j and k that
satisfy the above equations came to him, and the rest is history.
Hamilton was so proud of his quaternions that he demanded that they are to be studied
in school. Soon, they became a compulsory examination topic in Dublin. He also founded
a ‘school of quaternionists’ to continue to popularise the subject. One reason why
Hamilton was so obsessed with quaternions was the discovery that they can describe what
we nowadays call vectors – a word coined by Hamilton himself – and the operations which
are referred to as the scalar and vector products.
Unfortunately, in the 1880s, today’s vector techniques, spearheaded by Gibbs and
Heaviside, began taking over, partly because the way Hamilton described quaternions
in his posthumous book Elements of Quaternions, containing no fewer than 762 pages,
was difficult to read. Physicists started to favour Gibbs’ and Heaviside’s approach
to vectors, which was seen to be simpler.
The story, however, does have a happy ending. At around the start of this century,
quaternions were brought back to life, finding applications in computer vision, quantum
physics, robotics and in the fast implementation of three-dimensional computer graphics.
This is because quaternions can describe spatial rotations in a more compact way than
using other methods such as matrices, allowing such rotations to be implemented in a
more efficient manner. Thus, almost 200 years later, Hamilton can finally have a
contented sigh in his grave.
