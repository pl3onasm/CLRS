$\Large{\color{Rosybrown}\text{Problem}}$

Given a pattern $P[0:m-1]$ and a text $T[0:n-1]$, find all occurrences of $P$ in $T$. It is assumed that $n \geq m$. The result should consist of the indices indicating where each occurrence of $P$ in $T$ starts, i.e. the valid shifts for $P$ in $T$.

The naive string-matching algorithm slides the pattern $P$ one position at a time along the text $T$, at each position comparing the characters in $P$ and $T$ until either $P$ mismatches $T$ or $P$ matches $T$ completely.
Since there are $n-m+1$ possible shifts for $P$ in $T$, and each shift requires $\mathcal{O}(m)$ time to compare the characters, the algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}((n-m+1)m)$ time.

Clearly, this approach is inefficient for large texts and patterns. The reason for this inefficiency is that the algorithm does not take advantage of the information that is gained from previous comparisons. This is where the other string-matching algorithms improve upon the naive approach.
